> AI Research Lab – Copenhagen, Denmark

## Overview

yellow3 lab is an AI research lab based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Founded by Thomas Christian Melskens. We research and develop autonomous AI platforms.

## What We Do

yellow3 lab builds AI platforms where the interface is conversation and the output is real. No dashboards to learn. No manuals to read. No code to write. We focus on three research areas:

- AI Agent Architecture: Multi-agent systems that collaborate autonomously – interpreting intent, generating output, and ensuring quality.
- Design Intelligence: Teaching AI to think like a design studio, not a template engine. Every output meets professional standards by default.
- Prompt-to-Product: Turning natural language into real, working digital products – apps, games, dashboards, SaaS, websites, tools – anything.

## Our Philosophy

The best technology is the technology you forget is there. Technology promised to empower everyone. Instead, it created a priesthood – developers, consultants, agencies – standing between people and their ideas. We think that’s broken. So we’re fixing it.
